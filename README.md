# Gold Price Prediction

Predict gold prices using historical market data and key financial indicators with machine learning models. The project explores feature engineering, trend analysis, outlier handling, and model interpretability to achieve high prediction accuracy.

**Key Features:**

* Preprocessed and normalized historical market data, handled missing values and outliers.
* Engineered trend-based features using rolling averages.
* Built and tuned multiple models: **Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**.
* Evaluated models with **RÂ², RMSE, MAE**, and performed cross-validation.
* Visualized feature importance, residuals, and used **SHAP** for model explainability.
* Created insightful plots: correlation heatmaps, trend charts, histograms, and boxplots.

**Tech Stack:** Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | SHAP | ELI5
